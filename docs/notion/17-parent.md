[Pages](ref:page), [databases](ref:database), and [blocks](ref:block) are either located inside other pages, databases, and blocks, or are located at the top level of a workspace. This location is known as the "parent". Parent information is represented by a consistent `parent` object throughout the API.

General parenting rules:

- Pages can be parented by other pages, databases, blocks, or by the whole workspace.
- Blocks can be parented by pages, databases, or blocks.
- Databases can be parented by pages, blocks, or by the whole workspace.

> These parenting rules reflect the possible response you may receive when retrieving information about pages, databases, and blocks via Notionâ€™s REST API. If you are creating new pages, databases, or blocks via Notionâ€™s public REST API, the parenting rules may vary. For example, the parent of a database currently must be a page if it is [created](https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-database) via the REST API.

> Refer to the API reference documentation for creating [pages](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-page), [databases](https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-database), and [blocks](https://developers.notion.com/reference/patch-block-children) for more information on current parenting rules.
